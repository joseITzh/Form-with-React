## Laser Tag Company Form

---

I have created a form to book a session at my laser tag company using:

- The react hook form
- A datepicker component (To select a date and hour)
- The library Yup (To create a schema-based form validation for the name, email and number of people)

It shows the informations provided by the user in an alert.
